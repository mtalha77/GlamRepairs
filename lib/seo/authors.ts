/**
 * Author and medical-reviewer registry — the E-E-A-T backbone.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Skincare is YMYL ("Your Money or Your Life"). Google holds it to the
 * strictest quality bar in search, and sites that publish YMYL content without
 * a named, credentialed author and a visible reviewer are the exact profile
 * that core updates demote.
 *
 * A byline alone is not enough. Google's raters look for a bio *page* carrying
 * the credential, the registration number where one exists, a photo, and links
 * out to verifiable profiles. That is what `/authors/[slug]` renders from here.
 *
 * ── One decision you have to make ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * E-E-A-T cannot be done anonymously. The practitioner's real name and
 * credentials must be public for any of this to work. If the brand would
 * rather stay unnamed, the honest answer is that the blog strategy does not
 * work in a YMYL niche and the budget belongs in paid instead.
